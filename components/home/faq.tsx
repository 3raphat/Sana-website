    question: 'Why is name Sana?',
    answer: (
      <>
        Sana means &quot;brilliant&quot; or &quot;praise&quot; in Arabic, and it
        can also mean &quot;gauze of summer&quot; or &quot;one who helps
        others&quot; in Japanese.
        <br />
        <br />I chose this name because I want Sana to be a bot that helps
        others and is always brilliant.
        <br />
        <br />
        But in reality, I just like the letter &quot;S&quot; and this name comes
        from Sana Minatozaki, a member of Twice.
      </>
    ),
  },
  {
    question: 'Sana source code?',
    answer: (
      <>
        I don&apos;t plan on open-sourcing Sana. I don&apos;t want other people
        to see my messy code ðŸ˜…. But I created a template for you to create your
        own Discord bot. You can find it{' '}
        <LinkWrapper href={links.templateBot}>here</LinkWrapper>.
      </>
    ),
  },
  {
    question: 'Sana is really free?',
    answer: (
      <>
        Yes, Sana is resolutely free. You can use all the commands without
        payment or votes required.
      </>
    ),
  },
  {
    question: 'Why is Sana sometimes offline or not working?',
    answer: (
      <>
        Sana is developed by a single developer. So sometimes I missed
        something, and Sana is not working correctly. If you find any bugs,
        please report them to me. I will fix it ASAP.
      </>
    ),
  },
  {
    question: 'Why does music sometimes play and then suddenly stop?',
    answer: (
      <>
        This is because I updated something that changed in Sana. So the bot was
        down for a few minutes. I&apos;m sorry for this inconvenience.
